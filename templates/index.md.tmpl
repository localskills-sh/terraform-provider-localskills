# Localskills Provider

The Localskills provider is used to manage resources on [localskills.sh](https://localskills.sh), a multi-tenant skill sharing platform. With this provider you can define skills and rules, publish versioned content, manage teams and membership, issue API tokens, configure OIDC trust policies for CI/CD pipelines, and set up enterprise SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning -- all as Terraform-managed infrastructure.

Use this provider to codify your organization's skill library and access controls. Teams can collaborate on shared skills while Terraform ensures that configuration stays consistent, auditable, and reproducible across environments.

## Example Usage

## Authentication

The provider requires an API token to authenticate with the localskills.sh API. Tokens follow the format `lsk_` followed by 64 hexadecimal characters.

You can obtain a token from your localskills.sh account settings or by creating one with the `localskills_user_token` or `localskills_team_token` resources.

The recommended approach is to set the `LOCALSKILLS_API_TOKEN` environment variable:

```sh
export LOCALSKILLS_API_TOKEN="lsk_your_token_here"
```

Alternatively, you can set the `api_token` attribute directly in the provider block. Avoid hard-coding tokens in version-controlled files; use Terraform variables or a secrets manager instead.

The `base_url` defaults to `https://localskills.sh` and can be overridden with the `LOCALSKILLS_BASE_URL` environment variable or the `base_url` provider attribute for self-hosted or staging environments.
