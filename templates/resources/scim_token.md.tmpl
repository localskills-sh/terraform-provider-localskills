# localskills_scim_token (Resource)

Manages a SCIM provisioning token for a team on [localskills.sh](https://localskills.sh). SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) tokens are used by identity providers such as Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace to automatically provision and deprovision users and groups via the SCIM 2.0 protocol.

All user-settable fields (`tenant_id`, `name`, `expires_in_days`) are immutable. Changing any of these attributes forces resource replacement (the existing token is revoked and a new one is created).

The optional `expires_in_days` attribute sets the token lifetime. If omitted, the token does not expire. Configure this token in your identity provider's SCIM integration settings to enable automated user lifecycle management.

~> **Critical:** The `token_value` attribute is only available at creation time. The API does not return the raw token value on subsequent reads. If your Terraform state is lost, the token value cannot be recovered and you must create a new token. Store your Terraform state securely (e.g., using an encrypted remote backend). Importing an existing token will **not** recover the `token_value`.

## Import

Import a SCIM token using the tenant ID and token ID separated by a slash. Note that the `token_value` will not be populated after import.

```sh
terraform import localskills_scim_token.example <tenant_id>/<token_id>
```
