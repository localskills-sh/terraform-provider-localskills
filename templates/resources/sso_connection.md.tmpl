# localskills_sso_connection (Resource)

Manages the SAML SSO connection for a team on [localskills.sh](https://localskills.sh). This is a singleton resource -- each team has at most one SSO connection. The resource configures how team members authenticate using an external identity provider (IdP) such as Okta, Azure AD, or Google Workspace.

Both create and update operations use the same underlying API endpoint (PATCH). The provider treats the SSO configuration as an upsert: if no SSO connection exists it will be created, and if one already exists it will be updated.

At least one of `metadata_url` or `metadata_xml` must be provided. The `metadata_url` points to the IdP's metadata endpoint for automatic configuration, while `metadata_xml` allows providing the raw SAML metadata directly. The `email_domains` attribute restricts which email domains can use SSO to sign in.

~> **Note:** Deleting this resource does not remove the SSO connection. Instead, it disables SSO by setting `enabled` and `require_sso` to `false`. To fully reconfigure SSO, create a new `localskills_sso_connection` resource.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/localskills_sso_connection/resource.tf" }}

## Import

Import an SSO connection using the tenant ID only (since SSO is a singleton per team):

```sh
terraform import localskills_sso_connection.example <tenant_id>
```
