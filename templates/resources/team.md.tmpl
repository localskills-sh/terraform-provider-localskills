# localskills_team (Resource)

Manages a team (also referred to as a tenant) on [localskills.sh](https://localskills.sh). Teams are the organizational unit that owns skills, tokens, and enterprise configurations.

The `slug` attribute is auto-generated from the team name but can be customized by setting it explicitly. The slug is used in URLs and must be unique across the platform.

The `description` attribute is optional and can be updated at any time along with the team `name` and `slug`.

~> **Important:** Deleting this resource removes the team from Terraform state only. The team is **not** deleted from localskills.sh because the platform API does not provide a delete endpoint for teams. To fully remove a team, contact localskills.sh support.
