# localskills_team_invitation (Resource)

Sends an invitation to a user to join a team on [localskills.sh](https://localskills.sh). The invited user receives an email with a link to accept the invitation.

All user-settable fields on this resource are immutable. Changing `tenant_id`, `email`, or `role` will destroy the existing invitation and create a new one (replacement). Invitations expire after 7 days from creation.

The `role` attribute determines the permissions granted to the invited user. Available roles are `owner`, `admin`, `member`, and `viewonly`. Only users with the `owner` role can invite other users as `owner`.

~> **Note:** Deleting this resource removes the invitation from Terraform state only. There is no API endpoint to revoke a pending invitation. The invitation will expire naturally after 7 days if not accepted.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "localskills_team_invitation" "alice" {
  tenant_id = localskills_team.engineering.id
  email     = "alice@example.com"
  role      = "member"
}

resource "localskills_team_invitation" "bob_admin" {
  tenant_id = localskills_team.engineering.id
  email     = "bob@example.com"
  role      = "admin"
}
```
