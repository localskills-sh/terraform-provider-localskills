# localskills_user_token (Resource)

Manages a user-scoped API token on [localskills.sh](https://localskills.sh). User tokens authenticate API requests on behalf of the currently authenticated user and inherit all of that user's permissions across teams.

The `name` attribute is immutable. Changing it forces resource replacement (the existing token is deleted and a new one is created). Each user can have a maximum of 25 tokens.

User tokens differ from team tokens in scope: a user token grants access to all teams the user belongs to, while a team token is limited to a single team's resources.

~> **Critical:** The `token_value` attribute is only available at creation time. The API does not return the raw token value on subsequent reads. If your Terraform state is lost, the token value cannot be recovered and you must create a new token. Store your Terraform state securely (e.g., using an encrypted remote backend). Importing an existing token will **not** recover the `token_value`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "localskills_user_token" "personal" {
  name = "Development Token"
}
```

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) When the token was created.
- `expires_at` (String) When the token expires.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the token.
- `last_used_at` (String) When the token was last used.
- `token_value` (String, Sensitive) The secret token value. Only available after creation.

## Import

Import a user token using its unique identifier. Note that the `token_value` will not be populated after import.

terraform import localskills_user_token.example <token_id>
```
