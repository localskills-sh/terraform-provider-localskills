# localskills_skill (Resource)

Manages a skill on the [localskills.sh](https://localskills.sh) platform. Skills are the core content unit -- they contain instructions, guidelines, or rules that can be shared across teams and tools.

Each skill has a `type` of either `skill` (general-purpose instructional content) or `rule` (enforceable policy content). The type is set at creation and cannot be changed afterward; modifying it forces resource replacement.

Visibility controls who can discover and use the skill: `public` skills appear in the explore feed, `private` skills are only accessible to team members, and `unlisted` skills are accessible by direct link but not listed publicly.

The `content` attribute sets the initial content when the skill is created. To publish updates after creation, use the `localskills_skill_version` resource to create new versions. The `slug` is auto-generated from the skill name and is used in URLs. Tags are limited to 5 per skill with a maximum of 50 characters each. Content has a maximum size of 512 KB.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a public skill
resource "localskills_skill" "eslint_rules" {
  tenant_id   = localskills_team.engineering.id
  name        = "ESLint Rules"
  description = "Standard ESLint configuration for all TypeScript projects."
  type        = "rule"
  visibility  = "public"
  content     = file("${path.module}/rules/eslint.md")
  tags        = ["linting", "typescript", "standards"]
}

# Create a private team skill
resource "localskills_skill" "deploy_guide" {
  tenant_id   = localskills_team.engineering.id
  name        = "Deployment Guide"
  description = "Internal deployment procedures and checklists."
  type        = "skill"
  visibility  = "private"
  content     = "# Deployment Guide\n\nFollow these steps..."
}
```
