# localskills_oidc_trust_policies (Data Source)

Lists all OIDC trust policies configured for a team. Each policy defines which CI/CD pipelines can authenticate using OpenID Connect tokens and which skills they can access.

Use this data source to audit trust policies, verify CI/CD access configurations, or reference existing policies in other parts of your Terraform configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "localskills_oidc_trust_policies" "all" {
  tenant_id = localskills_team.engineering.id
}

output "policy_names" {
  value = [for p in data.localskills_oidc_trust_policies.all.policies : p.name]
}
```
