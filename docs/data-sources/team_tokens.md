# localskills_team_tokens (Data Source)

Lists all API tokens for a team. Token secret values are not included; only metadata such as name, creator, creation date, and last-used timestamp is returned. Requires owner or admin role on the team.

Use this data source to audit team tokens, identify unused or expiring tokens, or verify CI/CD token inventory.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "localskills_team_tokens" "all" {
  tenant_id = localskills_team.engineering.id
}

output "token_names" {
  value = [for t in data.localskills_team_tokens.all.tokens : t.name]
}
```
