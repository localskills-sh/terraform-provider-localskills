# localskills_skill_content (Data Source)

Fetches the actual content of a skill, optionally at a specific version. Supports exact version number, exact semantic version, or semver range queries.

Use this data source to retrieve skill content for use in other resources or to inspect content at a particular version. When no version parameters are specified, the latest version is returned.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Get content at a specific semver range
data "localskills_skill_content" "latest_v1" {
  skill_id = "sk_abc123"
  range    = "^1.0.0"
}

output "content" {
  value = data.localskills_skill_content.latest_v1.content
}
```
