# localskills_scim_tokens (Data Source)

Lists all SCIM provisioning tokens for a team. Token secret values are not included; only metadata such as name, creation date, and last-used timestamp is returned.

Use this data source to audit SCIM tokens, check expiration dates, or verify that provisioning tokens are active and in use.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "localskills_scim_tokens" "all" {
  tenant_id = localskills_team.engineering.id
}

output "scim_token_names" {
  value = [for t in data.localskills_scim_tokens.all.tokens : t.name]
}
```
